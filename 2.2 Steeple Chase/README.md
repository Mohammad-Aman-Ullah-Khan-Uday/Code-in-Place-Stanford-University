**Your task:** The program that Mehran works through in assignment 2\.

This program allows Karel to run a "Steeple Chase" (like a hurdles race, but with arbitrarily large hurdles) where:

* Karel starts at position (1, 1), facing East (aka right).  
* The steeple chase is guaranteed to be 9 columns long.  
* There can be arbitrarily many hurdles that can be of arbitrary size, located between any two corners  
   in the world.  
* Karel should "jump" each hurdle one at a time. For example, if you were to execute the SteepleChase program, you would see something like the following before-and-after diagram
